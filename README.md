## MusicMatch

MusicMatch is a full stack Ruby on Rails website designed to connect live music fans. It allows individuals to search Ticketmaster events using keywords for event information and then create a meetup request. Other fans can search for meetup requests for the shows they would like to attend and then match with those events and attend the show with the other matched fans. Fans can also utilize a chatroom to connect with fellow fans. The site also has a newsfeed for event creation. It was created as a group final project at New York Code + Design Academy in June 2018.
